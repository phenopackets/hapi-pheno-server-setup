# Use this file to set project specific settings
# "project" here means a fork of the upstream ShahimEssaid/hapi-compose-setup for a use by a project
# This file should focus on setting HS_PROFILES and other variables to values needed by all the "run instances"
# of the project.
# A local "run" of the project can further override the settings for the local "instance" in env-init-local.py
# to set instance specific values.

# See config/env-init-local-example.py for possible values to set here or in the local file.
# The full list of environment variables is in config/env-defaults.py.
